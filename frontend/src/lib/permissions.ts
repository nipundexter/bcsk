 * SEC-4: the single source of truth for what each admin role may do.

 * Before this existed, the admin sidebar computed `isSupport`/`isIT`/`isSuper` to decide
 * which links to render, while every action behind those links called plain
 * `requireAdmin()` — which accepts all three admin roles. Server Actions are directly
 * invocable HTTP endpoints, so an IT_SUPPORT account could verify payments, issue refunds
 * and approve admissions; it simply could not see the buttons.
 *
 * Both the menu (SEC-5) and the server-side guards (SEC-4.1) now read this map, so the
 * two cannot disagree. Adding a module means adding a permission here and nowhere else.
